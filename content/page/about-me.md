## 🔭 About me
- Hey guys, Dat is here to write some story. Everyone has their own story, so I will let it slide here. Enjoy!

- 👀 As the Vice President of SOICT Innovation Club, I will manage all of the aspect of our club. Together we go wild!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Engineering at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Currently I'm on my fourth years.

- 💞️ In my free times I like chilling out, having some coffee, playing some games or just simply earning myself some rest.
